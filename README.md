This a repository for my old and previous code that I have written.

Currenly working on making clone/similar game to the Nintendo Game 
called Adventure of Lolo using no external libraries or framework.
The Code are under Project:Labyrinth.
Link to most recent Video featuring my latest project: http://youtu.be/m7j5arOr5BU
Link should be updated every week or so.
All the gameplay/mechanic have been programmed therefore this project is done as seen on the last video.
